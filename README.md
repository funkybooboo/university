## Acronyms
### DMA: Direct Memory Access
A feature that allows hardware devices to access the main system memory independently of the CPU, enhancing system performance during data transfers.

### SMP: Symmetric Multiprocessing
An architecture where two or more identical processors share the same main memory, allowing them to work on tasks simultaneously for improved performance and reliability.

### MBR: Master Boot Record
A boot sector located at the beginning of a storage device that contains the partition table and boot loader code, crucial for starting the operating system.

### UEFI: Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
A modern firmware interface that replaces the traditional BIOS. UEFI provides a more flexible pre-boot environment, allowing for faster boot times, larger disk support (over 2 TB), and enhanced security features like Secure Boot. It includes a graphical interface, supports booting from various file systems, and allows for greater customization and management of system settings.

### GUID: Globally Unique Identifier

### CIA
- **Confidentiality**: Ensures that information is only accessible to authorized individuals through measures like encryption, access controls, and authentication.
- **Integrity**: Ensures data is accurate, authentic, and reliable, protecting against unauthorized modifications. Techniques such as checksums, hashing, and digital signatures are commonly used.
- **Availability**: Ensures that information and resources are accessible to authorized users when needed, utilizing measures like redundancy, failover systems, and regular maintenance to prevent downtime.

### PCB: Process Control Block
A vital data structure in an operating system that stores essential information about a process, such as its unique Process ID (PID), current state, and program counter. It facilitates context switching by saving and restoring the CPU registers and scheduling information, enabling efficient multitasking. Additionally, the PCB tracks memory management and I/O status, allowing the operating system to manage resources and process communication effectively.
