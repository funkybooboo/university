Instead, I want you to do a solo review of the C++ team's UML diagram and SDP.  Write responses to these questions in doc/Reviews.md:

```
What are your overall impressions about the C++ team's design?
```
I think they did an overall good job. My proof is that I understand what I need to build and where to take off from where the C++ team stopped. Tho I think they could have explained a little more.

```
What did you learn from the C++ team's UML Class Diagram?
```
It does not much sense I don't love UML Diagrams. There is so much you just have to know and assume about the information in front of you, and I would much rather read the code and understand the system that way because you are going to get a much more in-depth understanding by doing that. Other than that option their UML diagram got the job done by explaining things from a high-level view of the project.

```
What did you learn from the C++ team's Software Development Plan?
```
I think their wording is kind of confusing. They don't really dive into things and go over topics in only a few words or a sentence. What would have fixed this is they could have added more examples. Whenever I write my Plan I put in a lot of examples and a lot of explanations because if the reader can't understand what I'm saying at one point then they can look at my examples or my long explanation. And throughout my Plan, I talk about the same thing over and over again so if they didn't understand something in one part then they might be able to pick up on it with repetition. The C++ team didn't do any of that, and it makes their plan too short I think.

```
Did the class diagram help you understand/navigate the source code?
```
Yes, it pointed me to what had a relationship with what.


You don't need to write a lot of text - between 250-300 words is enough to get the point across.  Complete this as part of the Design phase; we'll look for this file to be committed at or before the designed tag.  The solo review replaces the old peer review in the rubric, and is still worth 10 points.

If you have already gone to the trouble of coordinating with your study buddies and have completed the peer reviews, I'll bend my rule about extra credit and give you 10 extra points to compensate for the extra work you did.  If you have already done peer reviews, you do not need to also write a solo review.
