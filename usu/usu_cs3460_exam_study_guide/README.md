# CS3460 Exam Study Guide

## Test #1 Details

- It is available to take on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, October 24th through 26th.
- The test is taken in the USU Testing center.  Be sure to schedule a time, in advance, to take it.  Note the testing center closes at 2:30 pm on Saturday, you must complete the test before then.
- The test covers everything up to and including C++ classes (object oriented C++), along with use of smart pointers.
- It has 31 questions, but worth 51 points.  True/False are worth 1 point each, Multiple Choice 2 points each, Multiple Answer 2 points each.
- You have 60 minutes to complete the test once started.
- You may use my slides, my lecture notes, and the web site www.cppreference.com.  You may not work with another person in any way during the test.  You can reference the previous quizzes, but there aren't any questions from them on the test, just that the style and format is similar  You may not use a C++ compiler...I'm testing you, not the compiler.  I recommend downloading my slides and notes before starting the test, that way you have them immediately available.
- Class will not be held on Friday, to allow anyone who wants/needs to take the test at that time.
- While you can use a lot of resources during the text, you still need to study and be prepared.  You want to be prepared in advance, rather than relying upon being able to look information up during the test.  Reading isn't enough, practice writing sample code, trying out all the different things we've talked about in class.  I can't emphasize that enough, write a lot of sample code, it is so much superior to reading only I can't overstate its importance.
