# CS3460 Program 6: Life Simulator

## Overview
This project implements a simulation of Conway's Game of Life,
featuring various predefined patterns such as Acorn, Blinker, Block, Glider, Gosper Glider Gun, and Pulsar.

## Features
- **Patterns:** Includes several classic patterns that demonstrate different behaviors in the Game of Life.
- **Console Renderer:** Displays the simulation in the console using simple character representations.
- **Time-based Simulation:** Animates the evolution of patterns over a specified number of generations.

## Requirements
- C++11 or later
- A compatible terminal that supports ANSI escape codes for proper rendering.

## How to Build
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/funkybooboo/CS3460_Program6.git
   cd CS3460_Program6
   ```
2. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake
   ```

## How to Run
Then you can run `./ConwaysLife` or `./UnitTestRunner`.
Follow the prompts to view the simulation of different patterns.

## Patterns Included
- **Acorn**
- **Blinker**
- **Block**
- **Glider**
- **Gosper Glider Gun**
- **Pulsar**
