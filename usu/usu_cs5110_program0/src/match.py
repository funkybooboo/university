For simplicity, the file format is assumed (without checking) to match
the following format:

  bob:     alice,carol
  david:   carol,alice

and likewise for the applicant file,  and the identifiers should be
self-consistent between the two files.
If a match is unacceptable, it is not listed in the preferences.
