                I am to make a weather app that allows uses to click on a forecast reports and vote on how likely the weather is on that forecast.
                I will be using vue.js (a javascript framework) to make the app.
                I will need to make 3 API calls in total to get all the required data for the app.
                The first API call, I need to find out my Latitude and Longitude as well as location information such as city name. I can get this info by giving the API my IP address.
                Second API call, with the data from the first API call I can get the current weather data for my area.
                Third API call, I need to get the forecast data. This is the largest amount of data that will be returned.
                Once I have all the information needed I will display it on a single webpage and allow the user to interact with parts of the page.

                vue.js makes putting things in the DOM very easy. I will need to import the vue.js module and make a new app in my script.js file.
                From there I can have multiple things in my app.
                A Data object to keep track of the data my website is using.
                    this will need to have quite a few fields.
                        a counter for how many likes, unlikes, and neutral divs are on the page.
                        Three boolean values for if the data from the API calls are received. (Opening the page up with every successful API call).
                        String values for the messages shown to the user
                        As well as a list of the forecast data.
                A Methods object that will allow me to call methods from my website to make the webpage interactive.
                    This will need a function that turns the color of a forecast div from grey to green to red and then back to grey.
                I will also need to have a Mounted object that will call the APIs in order and update my website when all the data from the API calls are reserved.
                    API calls will go in here.
                    For all these API calls I will need to have a good .then .catch system to get any errors from the API calls.

                I got the implementation done. I just need to add better error handling with the API calls but I thought that would be best to do during the debugging phase.

                Alright I added error detection and there is no way there would be an error now. If there is, I display the error message and dont let the parts of the page that didnt get the correct data to load.
                I needed to change the format of my code to get this done in full. But it was good seeing how everything works together. Having three API calls is somewhat complex but I think I did it in an elegant way.
                I was having the issue that I was calling all three APIs at once and getting the wrong data but now it does one at a time and checks the data reserved. If there is an error anywhere then a message is displayed and and the further APIs dont get called.
                Fun project!

                I dont think any parts of my program are witten sloppy. It is my first Vue.js project so im sure that I did something newbie but I understand everything.
                I am sure there is a way better way of doing things then what I did. I heard something about build tools and in the future I would want to use those but for now I understand the basics.
                If a bug is reported it would be easy to fix since the porgram is small and not complex.
                I think my docs are easy enough to understand and anyone that knows basic vue.js would easily be able to understand what my program is doing.
                To add a new feature it would be easy since vue.js makes it easy to play with the DOM.
                My program will run for the foreseeable future as long as those APIs stay online.
                Ok did it.
